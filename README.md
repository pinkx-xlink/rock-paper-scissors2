Rock paper scissors second runthrough

12/7/23: 2 hrs (JavaScipt only) - Built the foundation for the project per the project instructions. 
I formed a better understanding of creating elements with JavaScript and assigning to them attributes, variables, and functions. I exercised my knowledge of loops, arrays, and variable incrimentors and decrementers.

12/14/23: 4 hrs - After creating a new experimental branch (per the instructions from second part of the Rock, Paper, Scissors lesson of The Odin Project), I appended new HTML elements using JavaScript; redefined playerSelection and created new functions and variables to display player input and computer's randomized selection in the console as well as on the document. I formed a better understanding of setting and applying id's using JavaScript. 

12/18/23: after moving getPlayerSelection into playRound(), playerSelection shows as valid in the if/else statement, but console only returns/log computer's choice. :p 30 min

12/19/23: After 2 hours of debugging, deleting, copy + pasting, and refactoring, most of the bugs have been worked out; both the player and computer once again get a turn each for each round, the scores are displayed on the screen, the event listeners all do what they should. However, I'm at a loss for why my win() and lose() aren't working now. I tried assigning id's to the playerSelection options, moving functions into/away from each other, making minor and larger more risky syntax tweaks.
